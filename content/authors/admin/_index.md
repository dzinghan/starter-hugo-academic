I'm a second-year MSc student at [Universit√© de Montr√©al](https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/home/) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) supervised by [Prof. Bang Liu](http://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~liubang/index.html). My research interests are mainly in natural language processing, specifically reasoning and knowledge of large language models.

I have previously interned at IBM, Microsoft (Nuance Communications), and Grant Thornton (RCGT).

I graduated from McGill University with a BSc in Joint Honours Mathematics and Computer Science in May 2023. At McGill, I was the Research Representative of [McGill Computer Science Undergraduate Society](https://mcgill-csus.ca/) for the 2022-2023 school year. Previously, I was a research assistant at [DMaS](https://dmas.lab.mcgill.ca/index.html) with [Prof. Benjamin Fung](https://dmas.lab.mcgill.ca/fung/index.htm), [Roger Tomlinson Lab](https://tomlinson.lab.mcgill.ca/) with Prof. Renee Sieber, and [.txtlab](https://txtlab.org/) with [Prof. Andrew Piper](https://piperlab.mcgill.ca/).
