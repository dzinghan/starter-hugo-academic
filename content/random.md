## A bit more about me :)
<!-- I love bears such as Rilakkuma, Brown from LINE Friends, and Kumamon. -->

<!-- My favorite games are *Mario Kart 8 Deluxe* and *Super Mario Odyssey*. I'm currently playing *Luigi's Mansion 3* and *Kirby and the Forgotten Land*.  -->
I was born in Beijing, China and I have been living in Montreal, Canada for almost 20 years, from elementary to graduate school. 
<!-- however, people always recognize my beijing dialect when i speak chinese -->

In my free time, I do a bit of everything. Tasting new cuisine, watching YouTube videos, looking at my next travel destination, window shopping, or even playing video games.

## Travel
You can shoot me a message to talk about travels. I love tasting local cuisine, visiting attractions, and experiencing new cultures, from going on solo trips to simply visiting my extended family. I've been to around 30 countries. If you have suggestions for cities/countries to visit feel free to share!
